## 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the `openllmetry` repository on GitHub to your personal account. You can find the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

## 2. Clone the Repository

After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

## 3. Make Local Changes

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:

Now, create a new branch for your changes:

Make your changes locally, and once you're happy with them, stage the changes:

Then, commit them with a meaningful message:

## 4. Pull Changes to Local Repository

Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary.

## 5. Create the Pull Request

Now, head back to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Compare & Pull Request" button. Fill in the details of the pull request (PR), such as the description of your changes, and submit the PR.
